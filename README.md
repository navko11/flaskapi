R1. Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.

The concept of the app is an online shop where the app will:

- Create information such as users and orders
- Update current orders and their status accordingly
- Delete records when appropriate to prevent any redundant information 


R2. Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Many apps share the same concept of an online shop, and one of the problems is that some of the apps may be difficult to use, store alot of redundant information and apply no normalization, etc.
A good app should be an app that makes information easy to record and easy to collect and read.


R3. Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?

I have chosen this database system for the reason that many businesses are outdated and still keep records by writing in books.
This database system proves to be more effecient, safe and manageable.

The drawbacks for example, may be the maintenance required to keep the database up to date and the security to protect the information


R4. Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM

The functionalities of an ORM is that it takes objects in code and connects them to the database.
The benefits of an ORM helps developers to to handle CRUD operations without using the use of SQL queries.
When interacting with the database it is also more optimized while using an ORM, making the work more smooth and efficient.


R5. Document all endpoints for your API
